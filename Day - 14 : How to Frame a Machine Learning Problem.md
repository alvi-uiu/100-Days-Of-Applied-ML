1. Business Problem to ML Problem
   First, I need to understand the real-world problem we're trying to solve. Then, I figure out how I can frame it as an ML problem.

Example: If the business wants to reduce customer churn, I would reframe it as: "Can I build a model to predict which customers are likely to leave?"

2. Type of Problem
   Next, I need to identify what type of ML problem this is. Is it classification, regression, clustering, or something else?

Example: If I’m predicting whether a customer will churn or not, it’s a classification problem. If I’m forecasting the revenue a customer will bring in, it’s a regression problem.

3. Current Solution
   Then, I look at what’s currently being done to solve this problem. Is there a manual process or another system in place? This gives me a baseline to improve upon.

Example: If the company is currently using a rule-based system to identify potential churners, I’ll use that as my starting point to measure the impact of my model.

4. Getting Data
   After that, I’ll figure out what data is available or needs to be collected. This is crucial because the model’s performance depends on having the right data.

Example: For churn prediction, I’ll look for data on customer behavior, like usage frequency, subscription duration, and past interactions with customer support.

5. Metrics to Measure
   Next, I decide how I’m going to measure the success of my model. I need to pick the right metrics based on the problem I’m solving.

Example: If I’m predicting churn, I might use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score. For something like forecasting, I’d use error metrics like MAE or RMSE.

6. Online vs Batch?
   Then, I determine whether the model will be used in real-time (online) or periodically (batch). This depends on how quickly decisions need to be made.

Example: If I need to predict churn as soon as a customer interacts with the system, it’s online. If I only need to update churn predictions once a week, it’s batch.

7. Check Assumptions
   Finally, I’ll check all the assumptions I’m making about the problem, the data, and the model. If my assumptions are wrong, the model might fail.

Example: I might assume that the dataset has an equal number of churners and non-churners, but if it’s heavily imbalanced, I’ll need to address that.
